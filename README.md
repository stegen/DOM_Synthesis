# DOM_Synthesis
DOM synthesis working group; October 2023

Quick notes in a README.md file so that we remember where files are and what we did this week. Each of the contributions came in via GitHub, and we have all the code used and developed this week.

We have files in two Google Drive places.
1. 'Data for Andrew' is a folder started by Bob Danczak --> this folder is holding the large data files which have been processed to various degrees. Originally the folder was used to hold the output from CoreMS. Other large-ish data files have been added over time.
2. 'DOM synthesis workshop' was started by Andrew Tanentzap --> this folder has some of the metadata files, PowerPoint presentations.
